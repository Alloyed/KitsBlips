# kitdsp-gpl

this is an extension to the kitdsp library that includes GPL-only source code, often copy-pasted or integrated from elsewhere. 

Any project that includes this project must comply with the GPL-license, as usual. but any code i write myself will remain MIT licensed, so you can thoughtlessly copy-and-paste it :)
